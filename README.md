## Technologies used:
* ### JDK: 11
* ### Spring Boot: 2.5.5

## !IMPORTANT! To make both projects run properly, run `kitchen-api` first, and only then `dinning_hall-api`

### If you want to run both projects in docker, in `dinning_hall-api` repository is located Shell script.
### 1. Clone both projects' directories into one general directory. 
### (e.g. "%commonD%\dinning_hall-api\" and "%commonD%\kitchen-api\")
### 2. Put both `1step.sh` and `2step.sh` scripts into general directory ("%commonD%")
### 3. Now you can create Docker Images, containters and run them in the same network just executing scripts.
